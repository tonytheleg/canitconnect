# CanItConnect - a 100DaysOfCode Project

CanItConnect is a re-creation of a tool a former teammate made at my previous employer to perform network tests from PCF. CanItConnect can (when its actually done) be deployed in platforms like PCF, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc and allow testing connectivity to internal and external endpoints. Its purpose was to expose a simple API, as well as provide a simple UI for developers to test that their apps (which would take the same network hops) have connectivity to their services without requiring all these network tools be available in their app containers.

The tool was incredibly handy in troubleshooting firewall, proxy, and connection issues, especially for those not strong in network testing tools on the command line. 

This project is a personal [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) project in an effort to break the tutorial death cycle and start having some fun wtih Go! Through this I'm hoping to learn a little more about Go web servers, creating both an API layer that can be used with tools like curl as well as a web console to provide a GUI test frontend as well. I'm hoping to dip into some WebAssembly as well!
